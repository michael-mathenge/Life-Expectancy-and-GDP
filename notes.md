**What we learnt throughout the process?**

Through the data analysis, we learnt about the increasing trends in both GDP and life expectancy over time for the selected nations.
We also gained insights into the positive correlation between a country's GDP and its life expectancy at birth, indicating a general trend of improved living standards leading to longer life expectancy.

**Are the results what we expected?**

The results largely align with the expected trends, as it is well-documented that economic growth often leads to improved living standards and, consequently, increased life expectancy.
However, the degree of correlation and the specific nuances within each country's data might have revealed some unexpected variations.

**What are the key findings and takeaways?**

The key findings include the consistent increase in life expectancy and GDP for the selected nations over the years, suggesting overall improvements in the well-being and economic prosperity of these countries.
The positive correlation between GDP and life expectancy reinforces the importance of economic development in promoting better healthcare, education, and overall standards of living.
The variations in the distribution of life expectancy across countries emphasize the importance of addressing socio-economic disparities to ensure more equitable access to healthcare and resources, ultimately contributing to longer and healthier lives for all populations.
