**Trend of Life Expectancy Over Time for Six Nations:**

The life expectancy at birth has generally increased over time for all six nations (Chile, China, Germany, Mexico, United States of America, and Zimbabwe).

###### Trend of GDP Over Time for Six Nations:
The GDP (in billions of dollars) has shown an increasing trend over time for all six nations, with variations in the growth rates. China and the United States of America have notably high and increasing GDPs compared to the other nations.

###### Correlation between GDP and Life Expectancy:
There seems to be a positive correlation between a country's GDP and its life expectancy. Generally, as a nation's GDP increases, its life expectancy at birth also tends to increase. However, other factors may also influence life expectancy.

###### Average Life Expectancy for Each Country:
The average life expectancy at birth varies for each country. This average is an important metric to understand the overall health and well-being of the population. The specific values can be found in the output of the average_life_expectancy variable.

###### Distribution of Life Expectancy Across Six Nations:
The distribution of life expectancy at birth across the six nations shows variations in the spread and central tendency. Some nations have a narrower distribution, indicating more consistent life expectancy, while others have wider distributions, suggesting more significant disparities in life expectancy within the population.

These findings provide a preliminary understanding of the relationships between GDP, life expectancy, and their trends over time in the selected nations. However, further analysis and consideration of additional socio-economic factors would be necessary for a comprehensive understanding of the determinants of life expectancy in these countries.
